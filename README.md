## Lozza User Interfaces

This is a sister project to my Javascript chess engine Lozza - https://github.com/op12no2/lozza - providing example web interfaces. 

You can try them here - https://op12no2.github.io/lozza-ui

They are designed to be mobile-friendly.  There is no app for the user interfaces but you can add a home screen link so that they are one click away. 

The mate-in-one game sounds easy, but it's often hard to see the mate quickly.
